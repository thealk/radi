Welcome!

In this experiment you will be asked to say some sentences at different rates of speech.
Please read the sentence silently to yourself first. 
When you are ready, the investigator will press a button.
Start speaking out loud when you see red text.

For this first block, say the sentences aloud at a normal, conversational speech rate.

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
