Now you will be speaking AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

Please read the sentence silently to yourself first. 
When you are ready, the investigator will press a button.
Start speaking out loud when you see red text.

For this block, say the sentences aloud AS FAST AS YOU CAN. 

Try to speed up your speech while still saying all the words.

Please practice this rate now by saying the sentence:
	BUY BOBBY A POPPY
as many times as you would like until you feel comfortable.

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
