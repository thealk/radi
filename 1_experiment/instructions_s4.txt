Now you will be speaking FOUR TIMES SLOWER than your normal speech rate.

In this experiment you will be asked to say some sentences at different rates of speech.
Please read the sentence silently to yourself first. 
When you are ready, the investigator will press a button.
Start speaking out loud when you see red text.

For this block, say the sentences aloud at a rate that feels FOUR TIMES SLOWER than your normal rate.

Try to slow down your speech by stretching out your speech.

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
