Now you will be speaking TWO TIMES SLOWER than your normal 
speech rate.

In this experiment you will be asked to say some sentences at 
different rates of speech. Please read the sentence silently 
to yourself first. When you are ready, the investigator will 
press a button. Start speaking out loud when you see red text.

For this block, say the sentences aloud at a rate that feels 
TWO TIMES SLOWER than your normal rate.

Try to slow down your speech by stretching out your speech.

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
