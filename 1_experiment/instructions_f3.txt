Now you will be speaking THREE TIMES FASTER than your normal 
speech rate.

In this experiment you will be asked to say some sentences at 
different rates of speech. Please read the sentence silently to 
yourself first. When you are ready, the investigator will press 
a button. Start speaking out loud when you see red text.

For this block, say the sentences aloud at a rate that feels 
THREE TIMES FASTER than your normal rate.

Try to speed up your speech while still saying all the words.

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
